\lettersection{About Me}

I am Gaurav Agarwal, currently working in Team Indus, Bangalore as Software Systems Engineer in Flight Software team. I graduated
as an Electrical and Electronics Engineer from P.E.S. Institute of Technology, Bangalore. From performing requirements analysis,
software design, coding, testing (the full RDCT life cycle) to leading the architecture design for innovative new software systems, I
have extensive experience as working part of a team to create useful and efficient products. My demonstrated success in meeting
expectations along with my dedication to working as part of a team prepares me to make a significant impact on your organization.

\lettersection{Why `Company Name`?}

`Company Name` gives a great opportunity for learning as it opens doors for a lot of applications like Automotive, Healthcare, and wide
varieties of other industrial grade products. Flourishing with increase in demand of the present technology, I personally believe that
I will have a newer perspective and learning from the team about the `technology` in day to day basis. Working in cutting edge
technologies is one thing that everyone looks forward to, enabling it for an individual in a global scale is what `Company Name` has
done in the long run, therefore I look forward for the present role.

\lettersection{Why Me?}

Upon review of your posting for an `Job Description` at `Company Name`, I am submitting my resume for your consideration. As an experienced professional with comprehensive experience in developing and testing `embedded software`, I am well positioned to exceed your expectations for this role.
