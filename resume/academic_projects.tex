		\item{Involved in complete design, development, assembly, integration and testing phase of \textbf{PISAT}\href{https://www.isro.gov.in/Spacecraft/pisat} - a nano-satellite under ex-ISRO experts.}
		\item{OBC and ADCS: The subsystem included building real time software for an imaging satellite in a component base manner which managed overall functionality such as attitude determination, control systems, telemetry and telecommand (RTE) on a Atmel \textbf{AT32UC3A0512 }\href{https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/AT32UC3A0512} micro-processor with bare metal architecture using Round Robin scheduler.}
		\item{Payload: Develop \textbf{NanoCam C1U }\href{https://gomspace.com/UserFiles/Subsystems/datasheet/gs-ds-nanocam-c1u-17.pdf} functionality, operations and test bench for complete analysis of setting of the camera parameters.}
		\item{Assembly, Integration and Testing: Build robust test system which was used for Avionics bring ups, \textbf{On-board in Loop Simulation (OiLS)}, independent verification of telemetry, telecommand, payload interface and ground checkout.}
		\item{Mission Planning and Operations: Reviewing and making of the detailed design documents for CDR, PSR, PLR, sequence of events, PISAT in orbit tracking and post data analysis.}
