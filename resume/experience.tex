		\begin{cvitems}
		\item{Writing, analyzing, and maintainance of software requirements for Lander \textbf{On-Board Computer(L-OBC)}, \textbf{Auxillary Flight Computer (L-AFC)} and Rover \textbf{On-Board Computer(R-OBC)}. Studying the feasibility with present architexture, providing solution for each module development and final independednt verification and validation.}
		\item{Developing software systems for \textbf{orbital}, \textbf{descent} and \textbf{surface} phases of the \textbf{Z01} lunar mission, with onboard state estimation, autonomous attitude correction, lunar terrain feature tracking, along with interface drivers for the \textbf{On-Board Computer (OBC)}\href{http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/ATF697FF.pdf}, interfacing cards and sensors, and limited fault detection, isolation, and recovery.}
			\item{Developing OBC boot architecture, custom linkers, make system and maintaining different configurations for Atmel's RAD Hard \textbf{ATF697FF} - \textbf{SPARC V8} processor operated as bare metal with \textbf{Round Robin} scheduler}
			\item{Developed framework for \textbf{Processor in Loop Simulation (PiLS)} system emulating sensor and actuator electrical interfaces to lander avionics unit. Responsible for regular comprehensive PiLS exercises of lunar lander avionics system.}
			\item{Developing and testing embedded applications for \textbf{L-AFC} and \textbf{R-OBC} which runs on barebones linux. Building kernel, firmware for the SoC using Petalinux and Buildroot toolchain.}
			\item{Developing frameworks for regression unit, interface and integration level of testing which involves sensor and other interface cards emulation and simulation using \textbf{Interface Emulation Card (IEC) }\href{http://zedboard.org/product/microzed/} and OBC.}
