		\begin{cvitems}
			\item{Developing software systems for \textbf{orbital} and \textbf{descent} phases of lunar mission, with onboard state estimation, autonomous attitude correction, lunar terrain feature tracking, along with interface drivers for the \textbf{On-Board Computer (OBC)}\href{http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/ATF697FF.pdf}, interfacing cards and sensors, and limited fault detection, isolation, and recovery.}
			\item{Design and testing of telecommand packet definition for the entire lunar landing mission: real time, absolute time tagged, patch, differential time tagged, configurable block and event based commands.}
			\item{Developing OBC boot architecture, custom linkers, make system and maintaining different configurations for Atmel's RAD Hard \textbf{ATF697FF} - \textbf{SPARC V8} processor operated as bare metal with \textbf{Round Robin} scheduler}
			\item{Developed framework for \textbf{Processor in Loop Simulation (PiLS)} system emulating sensor and actuator electrical interfaces to lander avionics unit. Responsible for regular comprehensive PiLS exercises of lunar lander avionics system.}
			\item{Developing frameworks for regression unit, interface and integration level of testing which involves sensor and other interface cards emulation and simulation using \textbf{Interface Emulation Card (IEC) }\href{http://zedboard.org/product/microzed/} and OBC.}
