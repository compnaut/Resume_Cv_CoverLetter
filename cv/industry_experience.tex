		\begin{cvitems}
			\item{Writing, analyzing, and maintainance of software requirements for Lander \textbf{On-Board Computer(L-OBC)}, \textbf{Auxillary Flight Computer (L-AFC)} and Rover \textbf{On-Board Computer(R-OBC)}. Studying the feasibility with present architexture, providing solution for each module development and final independednt verification and validation.}
			\item{Developing software systems for \textbf{orbital}, \textbf{descent} and \textbf{surface} phases of lunar mission, with onboard state estimation, autonomous attitude correction, lunar terrain feature tracking, and limited fault detection, isolation, and recovery.}
			\item{Interface drivers for protocol establishment with the \textbf{(L-OBC)}\href{http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/ATF697FF.pdf}, \textbf{L-AFC}\href{http://zedboard.org/product/zedboard}, \textbf{R-OBC}\href{http://zedboard.org/product/zedboard}, other interfacing cards and sensors.}
			\item{Developed software system to perform an \textbf{autonomous lunar descent sequence}, with onboard estimation of lander states, constrained landing site selection, targeted descent to selected landing site and mode transition logics.}
			\item{Design and testing of telecommand packet definition for the entire lunar landing mission: real time, absolute time tagged, patch, differential time tagged, configurable block and event based commands.}
			\item{Developing Lander OBC boot architecture, custom linkers, make system and maintaining different configurations for Atmel's RAD Hard \textbf{ATF697FF} - \textbf{SPARC V8} processor operated as bare metal with \textbf{Round Robin} scheduler}
			\item{Developing frameworks for running regression unit, interface and integration level of testing with auto code generation capabilities which involves sensor and other interface cards emulation using \textbf{Interface Emulation Card (IEC) }\href{http://zedboard.org/product/microzed/}, board bring-ups for \textbf{Integrated Avionics Unit (IAU)}, and generate reports for each activity.}
			\item{Developed framework for \textbf{Processor in Loop Simulation (PiLS)} system emulating sensor and actuator electrical interfaces to IAU.}
			\item{Developing and testing embedded applications for \textbf{L-AFC} and \textbf{R-OBC} which runs on barebones linux. Building kernel, firmware for the SoC using Petalinux and Buildroot toolchain.}
			\item{Maintain a complete dashboard for FSW team for coverage on code development, documentation and post tests analysis.}
			\item{Review Software artifacts created by the team members from time to time for \textbf{JPL} code compliance and \textbf{MISRA C - 2014} guidelines.}
