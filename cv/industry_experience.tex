		\begin{cvitems}
			\item{Developing software systems for \textbf{orbital} and \textbf{descent} phases of lunar mission, with onboard state estimation, autonomous attitude correction, lunar terrain feature tracking, and limited fault detection, isolation, and recovery.}
			\item{Interface drivers for protocol establishment with the \textbf{On-Board Computer (OBC)}\href{http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/ATF697FF.pdf}, interfacing cards and sensors.}
			\item{Developed software system to perform an \textbf{autonomous lunar descent sequence}, with onboard estimation of lander states, constrained landing site selection, targeted descent to selected landing site and mode transition logics.}
			\item{Design and testing of telecommand packet definition for the entire lunar landing mission: real time, absolute time tagged, patch, differential time tagged, configurable block and event based commands.}
			\item{Developing OBC boot architecture, custom linkers, make system and maintaning different configurations for Atmel's RAD Hard \textbf{ATF697FF} - \textbf{SPARC V8} processor operated as bare metal with \textbf{Round Robin} scheduler}
			\item{Developing frameworks for running regression unit, interface and integration level of testing with auto code generation capablities which involves sensor and other interface cards emulation using \textbf{Interface Emulation Card (IEC) }\href{http://zedboard.org/product/microzed/}, board bring-ups for \textbf{Integrated Avionics Unit (IAU)}, and generate reports for each activity.}
			\item{Developed framework for \textbf{Processor in Loop Simulation (PiLS)} system emulating sensor and actuator electrical interfaces to IAU.}
			\item{Maintain a complete dashboard for FSW team for coverage on code development, documentation and post tests analysis.}
\item{Review Software artifacts created by the team members from time to time for \textbf{JPL} code compliance and \textbf{MISRA C - 2014} guidelines.}
