		\begin{cvitems}
			\item{Developing software systems for \textbf{orbital}, \textbf{descent} and \textbf{surface} phases of the soft landing lunar mission, with onboard state estimation, autonomous attitude correction, lunar terrain feature tracking, active thermal and power control, interface drivers for sensors peripherals and other interfacing cards, with limited fault detection, isolation, and recovery.}
			\item{Writing, analyzing, and maintenance of software requirements for Lander \textbf{On-Board Computer(L-OBC)}, \textbf{Auxillary Flight Computer (L-AFC)} and Rover \textbf{On-Board Computer(R-OBC)}. Studying the feasibility with present architecture, providing solutions for each module development and final independent verification and validation.}
			\item{Interface drivers for protocol establishment with the \textbf{(L-OBC)}\href{http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/ATF697FF.pdf}, \textbf{L-AFC}\href{http://zedboard.org/product/zedboard}, \textbf{R-OBC}\href{http://zedboard.org/product/zedboard}, other interfacing cards and sensors.}
			\item{Developed software system to perform an \textbf{autonomous lunar descent sequence}, with the onboard estimation of lander states, constrained landing site selection, targeted descent to the selected landing site and mode transition logic.}
			\item{Design and testing of telecommand packet definition for the entire lunar landing mission: real-time, absolute time-tagged, patch, differential time tagged, configurable block and event-based commands.}
			\item{Developing Lander OBC boot architecture, custom linkers, make system and maintaining different configurations for Atmel's RAD Hard \textbf{ATF697FF} - \textbf{SPARC V8} processor operated as bare metal with \textbf{Round Robin} scheduler}
			\item{Developing frameworks for running regression unit, interface and integration level of testing with auto code generation capabilities which involves sensor and other interface cards emulation using \textbf{Interface Emulation Card (IEC)}\href{http://zedboard.org/product/microzed/}, board bring-ups for \textbf{Integrated Avionics Unit (IAU)}, and generate reports for each activity.}
			\item{Developed framework for \textbf{Processor in Loop Simulation (PiLS)} system emulating sensor and actuator electrical interfaces to IAU.}
			\item{Developing and testing embedded applications for \textbf{L-AFC} and \textbf{R-OBC} which runs on barebones Linux. Building kernel, firmware for the SoC using Petalinux and Buildroot toolchain.}
			\item{Maintain a complete dashboard for FSW team for coverage on code development, documentation and post-tests analysis.}
			\item{Review Software artefacts created by the team members from time to time for \textbf{JPL} code compliance and \textbf{MISRA C - 2014} guidelines.}
